Hi there,
this small blogpost will give you an update on what has happened between the two semesters and outline our plans for the ongoing second semester.

We slightly corrected our scope as outlined in the usecase diagram below:

Our main goal for this semester is to finish the upload and download usecases and also allow searching for files. 
Next to this the usecases for userprofile and permissions should be implemented.
If we have the time for it, we will also try to improve the security of our application.


By now we have decided what technology to use for the third microservice of our application:
Because we wanted to try something we haven't used before and are also interested in functional programming we choose Haskell.
You can find the repo for this service [here](https://github.com/FileFighter/FileHandler){:target="_blank"}. 

That's it with the quick update, have a nice day!
