This blogpost will be about retro stuff, which we really like, especially retro video games as you can probably tell from the design of our blog already.
Wait? I must have misunderstood that; the topic will be our Retrospective, an event from the scrum method, where you look back at the done work and try to find out what went well, what should be improved and how you can improve those things.

The retro was held by a professional scrum master, who provided a nice setting for the event.
Now we know which vehicle represents the current state of our project the best (and no, it is definitely not one of those [speeder bikes from star wars :)](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=start+wars+speeder+bike&t=brave&iar=images&iax=images&ia=images){:target="_blank"}.

So now we just want to share some results of the retrospective: 

Things we thought worked well:
* Communication
* Time effort
* Making the environments fit to us (like our blog, automated workflows, JetBrains(!), etc.)
* Team-building activities
* Test Driven Development

Some points about how we could improve:
* Avoiding tasks that are not relevant to the current scope
* Calculating with buffer when estimating
* Better long term planning (features, technical stuff)   
* Stay more on topic at meetings


That's it for this blogpost, thanks for reading and have a nice day!
