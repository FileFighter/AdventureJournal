This is where you will find all our cool stuff!

### Why we choose GitHub Pages and Jekyll:
We know everyone can create a blog with Wordpress. But we are CS Students so we wanted to do something different.
Using GitHub Pages for hosting and Jekyll for building our static HTML site we have the ability to write our Blog the same way we write our code.
Plus we are not dependent on a Service like Wordpress, we could easily move our Blog to an other Hosting Service.
While setting up the blog we encountered some problems, but managed to solve most of them.
With Jekyll we could easily create a site from a template and can simply write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to create the blog post and all the other sides. It is also super customizable and themeable.

Using GitHub gives us the ability to have almost everything on one platform. Peer Reviews can be done in the same place where the code is stored.
