This is where you will find all our cool stuff!

# Why we choose GitHub Pages and Jekyll:
We know everyone can create a blog with Wordpress. But we are CS Students so we wanted to do something different.
Using GitHub Pages for hosting and Jekyll for building our static HTML site we have the ability to write our Blog the same way we write our code.
