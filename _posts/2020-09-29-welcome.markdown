This is where you will find all our cool stuff!



### Planing Software

We decided to use youtrack, because we are jetbrains fansboys. 
So we got a project on the [youtrack instance of the DH.](dhbw-karlsruhe.myjetbrains.com)
The only alternative was Jira, because we all used it at work already.
Getting used to youtrack takes some time as it provides to lot of features and has a complex UI.
But with our skills we will get used pretty fast.


### Why we choose GitHub Pages and Jekyll:
We know everyone can create a blog with Wordpress. But we are CS Students so we wanted to do something different.
Using GitHub Pages for hosting and Jekyll for building our static HTML site we have the ability to write our Blog the same way we write our code.
Plus we are not dependent on a Service like Wordpress, we could easily move our Blog to an other Hosting Service.
While setting up the blog we encountered some problems, but managed to solve most of them.
With Jekyll we could easily create a site from a template and can simply write [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to create the blog post and all the other sides. It is also super customizable and themeable.

Using GitHub gives us the ability to have almost everything on one platform. Peer Reviews can be done in the same place where the code is stored.


One highlight of the blog could be the support for language highlighting as seen in this short test for java code snippets.

{% highlight java %}
package de.filefighter.rest;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
@SpringBootApplication
public class RestApplication {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(RestApplication.class, args);
	}
}
{% endhighlight %}
