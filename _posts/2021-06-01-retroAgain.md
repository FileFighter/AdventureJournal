Woooh you made it to this blogpost about our Retrospective at the end of the second semester.

At such an event the team is looking back at the previous sprints and tries to identify what went well and what should be improved.
The retro was moderated by a professional.

To break the ice, the first task was to describe the last sprint in form of a tweet. 
The results looked something like this:

Then we should answer some questions about our experience with the whole project on a scale of 1 to 10.
Like how much fun we had, how happy we are with the progress of our project and how much we had learned.

After that we meet with the Team Plandora to discuss some things that went well or went bad, stuff that confused us and ideas we had how to make things better.

We also talked about two topics in details and collected action to improve these.
Those topics were the dragging along of task over several sprints, and the problem of complex and bad planed use cases.

You can see a screenshot of the collected thoughts below:

The retro was an interesting experience for the whole team and gave useful results for future projects.

That's it for this blogpost, thanks for reading and have a nice day!
