Welcome back to our blog.
Although we are currently on vaction we are still thinking about ways to improve the experience of our readers.  
That's why we found a way to make our blog even better. Just kidding, BUT we found this nice way to include your feedback and comments on our blog.  
There is this nice tool called [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/). It enables you to leave a comment directly on this blog page. You only need to authorize the bot, which creates a issue with your comment on our blog repository.  
Happy weekend to you,  
The FileFighter devs.  

<i>Our devs are just crazily good. Thats why the implementation of [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/) just worked on the <strike>first</strike> <strike>second</strike> third try.</i>
