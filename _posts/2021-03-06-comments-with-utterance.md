Welcome back to our blog.
Although we are currently on vacation, we are still thinking about ways to improve the visitor experience of our blog.
On this mission we found a way to make our blog even better - one would not even have thought that this would still be possible. Just kidding, BUT indeed we dug up a more efficient way to include your feedback and comments on our blog.  
The tool we utilize for this is called [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/). It enables you to submit a comment directly on the blog page, therefore there is no need to switch to github and back again. You only need to authorize the bot, which creates an issue on our blog repository including your comment.
We wish you a pleasant weekend.
The FileFighter devs.  

<i>Our devs are just crazily good. Thats why the implementation of [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/) just worked on the <strike>first</strike> <strike>second</strike> third try.</i>
