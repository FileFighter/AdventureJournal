Hi there, this blog post will be about the documentation of use cases.

For this week we got the task to create Use-Case Specifications for two of our use cases. We choose the [permissions use case](/wiki/usecases/crudPermissions.html) for sharing files and directories and the [view folder contents](/wiki/usecases/viewFolderContents.html) use case. We created the activity diagrams for both use cases using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/){:target="_blank"} and started making frontend mockups with [Pencil Project](http://pencil.evolus.vn/){:target="_blank"}.
Next week we will also need to creat narration using [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/){:target="_blank"}. We will do this in our Java project where Cucumber is already set up.


Thank you for reading,

FileFighter Team.
