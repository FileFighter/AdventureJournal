Hi there,

this week we got an interesting task to train our refactoring skills.
This task was taken from the first chapter of [Martin Fowlers](https://martinfowler.com/) book 'Refactoring'.
Starting from [this code](https://github.com/gnilkreb/Fowler/tree/c0e1c7a21a5335d7e475c2c795ed77deec37b776) the task is to make the code better by following the individual steps described by Fowler.
