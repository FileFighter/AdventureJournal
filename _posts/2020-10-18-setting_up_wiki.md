Hey there!
This week we got the task to start with the documentation of our project and outline the Software Requirements Specification.
We were told to write the documentation in markdown. Because we are already using markdown for our blog we could easily integrate the wiki into it.
You can find the fist page of the wiki [here](/wiki). We had a nice template for the specification and started to fill out the information.

So checkout the wiki and maybe leave some feedback.
Thank you for reading!
The FileFighter Team.
