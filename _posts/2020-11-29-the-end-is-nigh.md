Hi there, 
this week we noticed that midterm is coming pretty soon. So we want to take this time to take a look at what we achieved by now.

We have chosen the framework [spring](https://spring.io){:target="_blank"} as well as the library [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot){:target="_blank"} for our backend.
For the frontend we are using the JavaScript library [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/){:target="_blank"} with some more libraries to extend it.


Here is a short screencast of our frontend:

Also check out our [SAD](https://filefighter.github.io/wiki/arch){:target="_blank"} document which we extended again. We added the deployment view and described the mvc pattern with more detail. The documentation of the UCs also got an update.




#### Blogging tip of the Day [2]!
Writing all those blog posts can be quite challenging sometimes, especially if you are not a native english speaker.
To prevent simple mistakes like spelling you just need to use the right tools that can help you.
 One favorite for me to do this is IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate which checks not only your code but also your spelling.
 Because we are using markdown for documenting and blogging we are writing it in the IDE any way.
 To check for mistakes on your whole site you can also use tools like [typosaurus](https://typosaur.us/) that will help you discover mistakes you have missed.
