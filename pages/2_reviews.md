On some of our blog pages, you can comment. To do that use the link on the bottom of the page.  
The links will be different for every page, taking you to our [github repository](https://github.com/FileFighter/filefighter.github.io/){:target="_blank"} and to the issues tab.  
For each page there will be a different issue where you can comment and discuss them.

To give us general feedback, you can create a new issue in our [issues](https://github.com/FileFighter/filefighter.github.io/issues){:target="_blank"} tab and label it as "feedback" or go to <a href="https://github.com/FileFighter/filefighter.github.io/issues">issues</a> to see all the open and closed issues.
